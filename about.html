                          After World War II, Germany needed to reform their police. This was due to the police brutality during the Holocaust, and they needed to make sure their police force maintained the safety of all its citizens and travelers in this country. Due to the reformation, Germany is a safer country. Germany is ranked sixteenth safest out of 163 countries in the world and is ranked eleventh safest out of thirty-six countries in Europe (Sylvester).

                          Police officers now go through many years of training and make sure that they all understand the law and ethics of the country. Sixteen states of Germany each have their law enforcement which allows for more protection all over the country (Bennhold). Police officers are found in many different locations including on public transportation, museums, and other famous landmarks. Bag checks are done in bigger buildings to make sure that no terrorist attacks can happen. Also, gun violence is rare in Germany and police officers will only use their weapon if it is the last possible solution. Germany is a safe country to travel to, which makes it a great place for many people to come and explore.

                  <p>The only thing that most tourists say that people have issues within Germany dealing with crime is pickpockets. Just make sure to leave valuables in your hotel and keep watch of your purse and wallet. Be aware of sketchy street vendors and try to eat at places that have a longer line because those tend to be better. Also, in Germany, following the rules is a strong part of their culture. Although Germans are very friendly and polite, they expect visitors to follow the rules, just like them. When drinking water in Germany, make sure to use a reusable water bottle and avoid plastic. Germany is a safe and clean country. It has so much to offer and is safe for families, females, and everyone that is looking for a great place to travel to. </p>
